# Dispute_Wizard
This web app was written as a training tool for my employer, B-Stock Solutions Inc. The app was written with a javascript front end and hooked up to a Firebase database. This tool walks dispute agents through every step of handling a new ticket, and helps them to track the status of the claims they are working on.
